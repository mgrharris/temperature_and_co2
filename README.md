# temperature_and_co2
In this project, I utilized Spark to perform analysis of the relationship between CO2 emissions and Global temperatures. 

First, I loaded in data on global temperatures, and used SQL queries in Spark to calculate the highest annual average temperatures per country. I also calculated the countries with the largest annual difference in temperature for the years provided in the dataset.

I next loaded in data on CO2 Emissions, and merged the two datasets on their common column; Country Name. I then was able to perform analysis correlating CO2 Emissions with Global Temperatures. 

This project was completed individually, using Spark in Google Colab.
